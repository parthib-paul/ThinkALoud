The study of cells is fundamental to biology, as cells represent the basic unit of life. According to the cell theory, all living organisms are composed of cells, the cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of life, and new cells arise only from the division of pre-existing cells. This theory provides the foundation for understanding both simple and complex organisms.

Cells can be broadly divided into two categories: prokaryotic and eukaryotic. Prokaryotic cells, which include bacteria and archaea, are generally smaller and simpler in structure. They lack a membrane-bound nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. In contrast, eukaryotic cells are larger and more complex. Found in plants, animals, fungi, and protists, eukaryotic cells contain a nucleus as well as a variety of specialized organelles that perform distinct functions.

Among the key organelles in eukaryotic cells is the nucleus, which stores genetic information in the form of DNA and acts as the control center of the cell. Mitochondria are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP through cellular respiration. Ribosomes, present in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, are the sites of protein synthesis. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exists in two forms: rough ER, which is studded with ribosomes and aids in protein folding, and smooth ER, which is involved in lipid synthesis. The Golgi apparatus further processes, packages, and distributes proteins throughout the cell. Lysosomes contain digestive enzymes that break down waste materials and cellular debris.

In addition to these, plant cells contain specialized structures not found in animal cells. Chloroplasts carry out photosynthesis, converting sunlight into chemical energy, while the cell wall, composed mainly of cellulose, provides structural support and protection.

All cells are enclosed by a cell membrane, a selectively permeable barrier composed of a phospholipid bilayer. This membrane regulates the movement of substances into and out of the cell, maintaining the internal environment and enabling communication with the cellâ€™s surroundings.
